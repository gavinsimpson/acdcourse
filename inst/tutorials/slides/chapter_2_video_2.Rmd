Cohort datasets often contain many discrete variables, for example with data
obtained from questionnaires. In this lesson, you'll learn when and how to tidy
up discrete data.

### A comment on "dichotomania"

> Dichotomania: The obsession to convert continuous data into discrete or binary data 

- Also called discretizing or dichotomizing 
- Example: obese = body mass index > 30 

First I want to mention a problem common in health research, known as
dichotomania. Dichotomania is an obsession to convert continuous data into
discrete data. It is also called discretizing or dichotomizing. For example,
obesity is defined as a BMI greater than thirty.

### Don't discretize continuous data

- Discretizing: 
    - Reduces statistical power
    - Little clinical value
    - Higher misclassification
    - Should be avoided 

Discretizing can cause a lot of problems. For instance it reduces statistical
power, provides little clinical value, and there is a higher chance of
misclassifying an individual's health risk. So, avoid it as much as you can.

### The problem of discretizing: An visual example

| Category | BMI range |
|:---------|:----------|
| "Underweight" | < 18.5 |
| "Normal weight" | 18.5 - 25 |
| "Overweight" | 25 - 30 |
| "Obese" | > 30 | 

``` r
# For next figure:
tidier_framingham %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_index)) +
    geom_histogram(colour = "black", fill = "grey80") +
    geom_vline(xintercept = c(20, 25, 30), linetype = "dashed")
```

You may be familiar with the different weight classes used according to your
body mass index, or BMI. These classes, shown in the table, are often used in
health research. Let's visually show why this is a problem. The code provided
creates the image shown next.

### The problem of discretizing: An visual example

![Discretizing a continuous body mass index.](images/ch2-v2-discretising.png)

BMI continuously occurs at every value from 10 to more than 60. The three
vertical lines are when discretization is applied to the data. Huge chunks of
people are classified with others even if they are very close to one of the
lines. For instance, someone with a BMI of twenty would be classified equally as
someone with a BMI of twenty-four point nine. Or, if someone gains a BMI of zero
point two, they could move from one category to the next. Biologically, this
makes no sense. So, as best you can, avoid dichotomizing variables!

### Reducing levels of naturally discrete variables

- Naturally/generally discrete: Usually no fractions 
    - "Pills taken": 1 or 2 pills, but not 1.5

- Reasons to reduce: 
    - Large error in measurement, e.g. "Eggs eaten daily?"
    - Data entry errors
    - Small sample sizes in some levels
    - Ease of interpretation

While discretizing a continuous variable is often discouraged, some variables
tend to be more naturally discrete. For example, you usually take one or two
pills, not one point five. Sometimes, reducing the number of levels in these
discrete variables makes sense, such as when there is large error in measurement
or data entry, small sample sizes in some levels, or easier interpretation.

### Reducing levels of naturally discrete variables

``` r
tidier_framingham %>%
    count(cigarettes_per_day)
```

```
# A tibble: 46 x 2
   cigarettes_per_day     n
                <dbl> <int>
 1                  0  6598
 2                  1   162
 3                  2    98
 4                  3   183
 5                  4    65
 6                  5   181
 7                  6    77
 8                  7    47
 9                  8    52
10                  9   149
# â€¦ with 36 more rows
```

Let's use cigarettes per day as an example and use the count function on the
variable. We can see that the values are integers. People usually report smoking
one or two, not one and a half. From the previous exercise you'll have seen that
more people report a rounded or estimated number, such as about ten or fifteen,
but rarely numbers like seventeen. And because there are few people in any given
integer, we could simplify the variable.

### Reducing levels of a discrete variable

``` r
tidier_framingham <- tidier_framingham %>%
    mutate(cig_packs_per_day = case_when(
        cigarettes_per_day == 0 ~ "None",
        cigarettes_per_day >= 1 &
            cigarettes_per_day <= 20 ~ "Up to one",
        cigarettes_per_day >= 21 &
            cigarettes_per_day <= 40 ~ "One to two",
        cigarettes_per_day > 40 ~ "More than two",
        TRUE ~ NA_character_
    ))
tidier_framingham %>%
    count(cig_packs_per_day)

```

```
# A tibble: 5 x 2
  cig_packs_per_day     n
  <chr>             <int>
1 NA                   79
2 More than two       145
3 None               6598
4 One to two         1133
5 Up to one          3672
```

We can tidy up and reduce a variable's levels by using the `case_when()`
function from dplyr. Since packs of cigarettes usually come with 20 cigarettes,
let's create another variable for number of packs smoked. `case_when()`
takes multiple arguments, each is in the form of a condition on the left of the
tilde and the output value on the right. So we set the first condition as when
cigarettes is zero and assign the value none. The next is when cigarettes is
from one to twenty, assigning the value up to one, and so on. The final
condition should be formatted as shown when outputting characters. When counting
the new variable, it now has less levels.

### Further tidying up

``` r
library(forcats)
tidier_framingham %>%
    mutate(cig_packs_per_day = fct_recode(
        cig_packs_per_day, 
        # Form: "New level" = "Old level"
        "More than two" = "One to two"
    )) %>%
    count(cig_packs_per_day)
```

```
# A tibble: 4 x 2
  cig_packs_per_day     n
  <fct>             <int>
1 More than two      1278
2 None               6598
3 Up to one          3672
4 NA                   79
```

Case when is useful for many situations, but the forcats package is specific to
tidying up factor variables. Use the `fct_recode()` function to edit and
rename levels directly. The argument has the form of the new level name then
equals old names. In this case, we now merged two levels together.

### Lesson summary

- Don't discretize, keep continuous data continuous
- Use `count()` to check categorical data 
- Use `case_when()` or `fct_recode()` to reduce levels

In summary, keep continuous data continuous. Use count, `case_when()`,
and `fct_recode()` functions to check and reduce categorical data.

Alright, let's do some tidying!
