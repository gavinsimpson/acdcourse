The purpose of epidemiology is to study disease. Two important terms related to
diseases in cohort settings are prevalence and incidence.

### Prevalent vs incident cases of disease

What are prevalence and incidence? Prevalence is a single snapshot in time and
counts the number of people who have a disease. Incidence is the number of new
cases of a disease over a specific period of time. Because of the time
component, incidence data is much more powerful at uncovering how exposures can
influence disease. This graph illustrates prevalence compared to incidence. At
visit zero, person one has a disease, so there is one total case, which is also
the one prevalent case.

At the next visit, person two develops the disease. There are now two prevalent
cases, but one of these cases is an incident case.

At visit two, person three also gets the disease. There are now three total
cases, or rather three prevalent cases at visit two, and only one incident case
since visit one.

Prevalence is always the number of cases at a specific time. For incident cases
though, we need to know the person's previous status, so it is more difficult to
count.

Over the entire period of follow-up, there are two incident cases due to person
two and person three.

### Incident data gives stronger scientific evidence

- Temporal aspect of an association 
    - Exposure preceding disease occurrence
- Participants at recruitment *shouldn't have the disease* 
    - If they do, it isn't incident data

It's this incidence information from prospective cohorts that is it's main
strength and what makes the study design such a powerful scientific tool.

With this temporal aspect of the design and analysis, evidence for a particular
finding is stronger compared to other study designs. Since the exposure occurs
before the disease develops, you are able to state with more certainty whether
it influenced the disease or not.

For this to happen, participants cannot have the disease at the recruitment
visit. Otherwise, it won't be incident data, as we saw in the figure. So, for
prospective cohort analyses, it's important to confirm prevalent cases during
the first visit.

### Counting number of cases at recruitment

```r
framingham %>% 
    select(prevalent_chd = prevchd,
           followup_visit_number = period) %>% 
    filter(followup_visit_number == 1) %>% 
    count(prevalent_chd)
```

```
# A tibble: 2 x 2
  prevalent_chd     n
          <int> <int>
1             0  4240
2             1   194
```

- `filter()` keeps rows matching `TRUE` logical condition 
- Drops rows with `!`, converting `TRUE` to `FALSE`, e.g. `!TRUE` equals `FALSE` 

Let's check the number of cases at the recruitment, or first, visit. First we
select and rename the variables to be more descriptive, then we use filter to
keep only baseline data when visit number equals one. Next, we count the number
of disease cases. Here we are counting the prevalent cases of coronary heart
disease, or CHD, which is a subset of CVD. One of the exclusion criteria for the
Framingham study was to not have CVD, but these participants were, likely
accidentally, included in the study.

Often during the baseline data collection, researchers find out that some
participants actually do have the disease and were accidentally recruited. This
happens even with the most rigorous practices, and is why exploratory data
analysis is so important. Part of your analysis must be to check these things
out and to confirm your assumptions. You'll also notice that we didn't use the
got cvd variable. One of the reasons for this is that CVD is composed of several
related diseases, such as stroke or CHD, so there are multiple variables that
contain information on CVD. These are variables we will need to check into as we
explore the data more and tidy it up.

Note that, in our code, filter kept the rows that match the true condition. In
this case, only the first visit. But if you want to drop rows, you can do the
opposite by using the exclamation mark to drop the rows that do not match the
true condition.
