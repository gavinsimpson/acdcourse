Hi! I'm Luke Johnston and I'm a diabetes epidemiology researcher. In this
course, we will discuss the general workflow for analyzing cohort datasets and
in this first chapter we will cover some of the basics of cohort studies and
designs. You'll also learn what type of data values to be aware of and to
consider when dealing with cohort datasets.

### What is a cohort study?

Features:

- Usually investigate risk factors for diseases
- Type of longitudinal study: Repeated measurements throughout time
- *Participants share common characteristic(s)*

So, what is a cohort study? Cohorts are scientific studies that investigate how
factors influence the risk for a disease. Cohorts are always a type of
longitudinal study where participants have repeatedly collected measures
throughout time. Most importantly, participants in a cohort all share a common
characteristic, hence the term "cohort". For example, the US Nurses' Health
Study only includes participants that are married, female nurses.

### Purpose and usefulness of cohorts

Cohort studies are fundamental to epidemiology and are a key study design for
answering questions about human health and behavior. Cohort studies are very
common in health and biomedical research. They help identify risk factors for
disease to better understand how to prevent and manage them. They are also
incredibly powerful for helping inform evidence-based clinical decision-making.

### Two cohort study designs

#### Prospective

Study participants:

- *Doesn't have the disease*
- Followed over time:
    - Multiple visits over time
    - Health and other conditions measured at each visit

#### Retrospective

Study participants:

- *Have the disease* 
- Take data from the past:
    - Asked about past conditions or past medical health records are examined

There are two main types of cohort designs, prospective and retrospective.
Prospective cohorts are the more common and arguably the most powerful form of
cohort design to study disease development.

Retrospective cohorts, on the other hand, are useful when health records are
easy to access or when it is impractical or even impossible to conduct a
prospective cohort.

The main difference between these designs is that for prospective cohorts,
participants don't have the disease at the start of the study, while for
retrospective cohorts they do. We will cover these designs in more detail later.

### Why are the basics important to know?

- Context is vital: Cohorts study health, so impacts on lives 
- Analysis and interpretation restricted by: 
    - Design type
    - What was measured and how
- Examples: 
    - Data with noise often in retrospective cohorts - be cautious
    - Measure is physiological abstraction - useful to transform

Cohort studies usually investigate some disease, so the results have the
potential to have a real-world impact on people's lives and health. As the
researcher, you need to know what data you are dealing with and how it was
collected in order to appropriately analyze and interpret the results. You need
to know the context of the data, so it's important that you understand the
basics of the study designs.

For cohorts, both the study design and the types of the measured variables
influence how you analyze your data.

For instance, retrospective cohorts tend to have imprecise measures because of
how and what data is collected, such as from questionnaires or medical forms. So
when interpreting your results you'll have to be extra cautious. Or, some
measures may be abstractions of a physiological process and applying some
mathematical transformation may create more meaningful and interpretable
results. This means there are many ways of analyzing cohort datasets. We'll get
into these concepts in more detail as we go through the course.

### Framingham Heart Study

We will be working with the Framingham Heart Study dataset. This study started
in the 1950s to investigate and establish the role of lifestyle on
cardiovascular disease. Many health tips, such as being physically active,
eating healthy foods, and not smoking, were first widely recognized because of
the results of this study. There are about 4400 participants, with data
collected a max of 3 times on the participants over the course of 15 years. This
makes it a great dataset to practice on for analyzing cohorts. You'll notice
that the data is a "tibble", which comes from the tidyverse. We make heavy use
of the tidyverse throughout the course so we recommend that you familiarize
yourself with it a bit.

### Lesson summary

- Features of a cohort: health, time, commonality
- Powerful study design to investigate health
- Two types: prospective and retrospective
- Using Framingham Study throughout course

To summarize, we covered features of cohorts, why we use them in health
research, the two design types, and that we'll use the Framingham dataset.

### Let's do some exercises!

Alright, let's do a few exercises to review and test your knowledge!
